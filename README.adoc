= Zap

A simple cross-platform orchestration and configuration management tool.

The main goal for Zap is to a simple mechanism for managing groups of computers
with varying configurations and needs. Zap accomplishes this with "tasks" which
can be composed into "plans" or run standalone. These tasks can be collections
of scripts or a statically linked binaries, which will be pushed to the target
machine(s) and executed.

Zap borrows ideas from
link:https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt.html[Puppet Bolt]. but leaves
some of the Puppet-based legacy from Bolt behind.
